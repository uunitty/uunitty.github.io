# Fix that PC!

Every time I have to open up a PC to fix it, it feels like an internal 500 error. I’m convinced I’m going to break something, that it won’t boot again, and that I’ll end up paying hundreds of euros to repair it. But every time, it works—and more importantly, I enjoy it. Mostly because I know what I’m doing, I do my research, and I take short breaks to avoid major mistakes.

Fixing PCs is in my blood. Still, I don’t do it often. I’m more of a software person: cybersecurity, programming, web development. My own systems are well-maintained, so they rarely need fixing. I also maintain devices for family members, and for the past three years, there’s been little need for repairs—unlike earlier, when I was constantly fixing things.

Why this post? To make a point. If you've ever wondered how a PC works, or wanted to build one but never dared to open one up—just do it. Buy an old machine and practice. Knowledge is built through experience. And if you break it, chances are someone nearby can fix it.

PCs, smartphones, laptops—these devices underpin the modern world. Those who not only know how to use them but also understand how they work and how to fix them have a future-proof skillset. Especially in the age of AI, technical literacy matters more than ever.

That’s it. Open your PC, replace the thermal paste, fix the cooler! You can do it!

Peace,

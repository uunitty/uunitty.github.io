# The future is now old man!

I've had multiple accounts in just 10 years. Scattered all across the internet: Mastodon, X, Facebook, Google, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. With multiple names, nicknames, my own IRL name, and profile pictures. Some of the time I followed content creators, other times politics, etc. But every time, I deleted these accounts. Every time I went back to square one: not having anything.

Well, this time I've re-joined the interwebs with a new name: Uunitty. Nice name, it was available. But what makes this attempt different? 

##### Nothing makes this attempt different. Apart from my own headspace.

I now have a job, a stable day-to-day schedule. I've learned to use the internet as a tool, as a place to connect. But I've also learned when NOT to use it. To read a book when I am overwhelmed with information. I know what platforms I like, what platforms are good for me. I do have opinions. I am not proud of every post I made in the past anymore. But I am here again, better, and here to stay.

I will focus on tech and all other things that interest me. You can follow me on X to see short posts, follow me here (this website has an RSS feed), or follow me on GitHub to see what shitcode I've created today. I am starting with a clean slate. Some might have an idea of who I am; for those, I ask you not to post my name online until I am ready to show my real identity. I am an ethical hacker, so if you OSINT my real name, email me at uunitty2025@gmail.com, and I will compensate you with 50 dollars (US, or Euro).

This is me, this is Uunitty.

Also, something totally different: don't you guys love it when you finally fix a PC after it hasn't run well for years? Fucking love that feeling. I will post about my journey with my first self-built PC and how it survived 8 years of torture soon.

Stay tuned.

Peace,
Uunitty.

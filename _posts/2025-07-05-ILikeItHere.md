After being offline for about a month or so and after deleting my old online identities and creating an entirely new one, I can say I like it on X. I like posting on this blog; I like this. I'm not entirely brainrotted like I was before, and I'm not paranoid about people finding my IRL name. I am myself, and I post what I like. More importantly, I do something I did not do on my old accounts: I think before I post. I don't let the worst part get the best of me. I am still able to see IRL apart from online. I have a life outside all of this.

Uunitty is a name to stay. For those who know who I truly am, this might come as a shock. I've deleted so many names, identities, and accounts, but this one is the one I like. I finally have an X timeline that's healthy, fun, and entertaining. I have a work-life balance. I have IRL people to care about. I touch grass, yet I have a fulfilling online presence as well.

Maybe you think: who cares? I do. That's why I post. Into the void this goes, but I like it. Maybe you do as well.

Maybe a shitpost, but I wanted to get this off my chest.

Cheers,

Uunitty.
